# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: Morgan Mast

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Summary

This app is an updated version of an app that generates a small profile of a random pokemon whenever you press the button to do so, and adds it to a recyclerview to see a history of all pokemon generated. Now the look of the app have been updated, including a new custom font and code to adjust the color of the text describing a pokemon's type based on said type.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🐁🐦🦎
