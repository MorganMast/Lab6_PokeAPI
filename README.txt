This app is an updated version of an app that generates a small profile of a random pokemon whenever you press the button to do so, and adds it to a recyclerview to see a history of all pokemon generated. Now the look of the app have been updated, including a new custom font and code to adjust the color of the text describing a pokemon's type based on said type.

- App contains a RecyclerView that displays a list of scrollable data
- App displays at least two (2) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item
- Use a downloadable font with custom color and size
- Modify the theme of the app in `themes.xml`
- Define and apply at least one style in **either** `themes.xml` or a new file `styles.xml`

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:
